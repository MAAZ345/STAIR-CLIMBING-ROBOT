# STAIR-CLIMBING-ROBOT
This repository encompasses the design and implementation of a stair climbing robot on the SolidWorks platform. The project focuses on creating a robot with three distinct parts capable of climbing stairs using prismatic joints while mutually supporting each other. The robot is designed to operate on a flat surface until it encounters stairs, at which point it utilizes sensors to detect the stairs and adjusts its movements accordingly.

Key design considerations include stability, a low center of gravity, a wide base for the bottom part to ensure steady movement, and a well-balanced relay mechanism at the top for effective stair climbing. The SolidWorks platform was chosen for its powerful parametric design capabilities, allowing for precise modeling and simulation of the robot's mechanical components.

This open-source project aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for enthusiasts, engineers, and roboticists interested in developing stair climbing robots. The repository includes SolidWorks CAD files, design documentation, and recommendations to facilitate the understanding and further development of similar robotic systems. Contributors are encouraged to explore, enhance, and adapt the design for specific use cases or contribute to the broader field of robotics.
